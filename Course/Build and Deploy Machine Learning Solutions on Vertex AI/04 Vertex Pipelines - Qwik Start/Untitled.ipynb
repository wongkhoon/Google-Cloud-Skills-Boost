Remember that when you defined the pipeline you passed a thresholds_dict_str parameter. This is the accuracy threshold you're using to determine whether to deploy your model to an endpoint. To implement this, make use of the Condition class from the KFP SDK. The condition passed in is the output of the custom eval component you defined earlier in this lab. If this condition is true, the pipeline will continue to execute the deploy_op component. If accuracy doesn't meet the predefined threshold, the pipeline will stop here and won't deploy a model."
